Lava Stacker
Help the hero cross the gap by stacking the blocks
Press 'alt+a' to start the game and 'b' to stack

- My two-level hierarchical object is the human. Legs also move when the player wins.
- lookAt() is demonstrated when the player wins the game and the hero walks across the blocks - the camera follows him.
- My custom polygonal object was a pyramid. They can be found on the spike balls that rise up from the lava at various points. They are flat shaded and textured by mapping an image.
- Frame rate is displayed on the bottom line of the screen.
